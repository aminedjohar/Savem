## Description

YouTube Video Downloader is a web application built with React and Express that allows users to download YouTube videos by simply providing a valid video link. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter the YouTube video URL, click the "Download" button, and the video will be downloaded to their local machine.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
